<!-- Position: 1 -->
---
If you have developed a plugin or a theme, you can include it on our repositories. Once approved, it will be displayed on the respective homepages: [Bludit Plugins](https://plugins.bludit.com) and [Bludit Themes](https://themes.bludit.com).

## Requirements
- The plugin or theme must be in a public Github repository.
- The repository must have a pre-defined structure (below the structure).

## Pre-defined structure for the host repository
On the root of the repository must be the source code and the following files are required:
```
languages/en.json
metadata.json
...
```

Here is an example of a repository with a plugin
- https://github.com/bludit-plugins/hello

Here is an example of a repository with a theme
