	de_DE.json

	fr_FR.json
	...
```

This is an example of an English dictionary `en.json`. Each line in `en.json` file is a key-value pair with the key on the left and the value on the right.

<pre><code data-language="JSON">{
	"theme-data":
	{
		"name": "Pure",
		"description": "Simple and clean, based on the framework Pure.css."
	}
}</code></pre>

As you can see, you have a field called `theme-data`, this has the name and description of the theme.

This is an example of a Spanish dictionary, the file is `es.json`.

<pre><code data-language="JSON">{
	"theme-data":
	{
		"name": "Pure",
		"description": "Simple y minimalista, basado en el framework Pure.css."
	}
}</code></pre>
